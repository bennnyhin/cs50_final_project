This is a web scraper website which allows users to see products that they are interested from the lenovo website and how the prices have changed over time. To start, users must create an account which is stored in a sqlite3 database with a password hash. This allows the user to have information specific to them and get a history of their favourite products. After logging in, the user can add products that they are interested in by going to the drop-down menu. By simply inputting the name of the product and the link to the product, users can add to their watchlist. After returning to the main page, users will see their watchlist products at the base model cost. Each time that the main page is refreshed, the web scraping is done again to allow users to get the most up to date price. Users can also go to the "add to history" drop-down which adds the products in their watchlist into a history database with timestamps. Following this, users can go to the history drop-down and look at how their watchlist products have changed in price over time. This will help them with their buying decision by providing a clearer picture of when to purchase a product.
